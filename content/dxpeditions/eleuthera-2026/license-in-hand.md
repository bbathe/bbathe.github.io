After applying back in November, my Bahamas license finally came through: **C6AFD**.

I submitted the application on **November 21, 2025**, and it took nearly two months to process. Not fast, but not terrible either. The important thing is it's done, and now I have a real callsign to put on the air from Eleuthera.

With the license sorted, all the major logistics are now locked in:

- **House rental** is confirmed with the property owner Steve connected me with.
- **Airline tickets** are booked: CVG → MIA → GHB on March 24, returning March 31.
- **Car rental** is reserved at Governor's Harbour.

This thing is actually happening.

I've already started on figuring out what gear to bring, what antennas will work at the QTH, and how much I can reasonably pack without paying American Airlines a small fortune in baggage fees.
