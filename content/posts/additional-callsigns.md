## Adding a New Callsign Before the Next Trip

I recently added another callsign, and like most things in amateur radio, the updates across all the different systems take more time than you’d expect. Since this will follow me onto future trips, I wanted to get everything sorted now rather than discovering a missing certificate on some island with spotty Wi‑Fi.

Here’s the sequence that worked for me.

### LoTW Comes First

Being able to confirm QSOs in [LoTW](https://lotw.arrl.org/) is critical, so that’s where I start. It can also take time for ARRL to review the request, approve it, and issue the certificate, so getting this done early avoids delays later.

I requested the new certificate in TQSL and waited for the automated email asking for proof. Once I replied and the certificate was issued, I imported it on the same computer I used for the request. After that, I exported the `.p12` file so I can bring it on whichever laptop comes with me on the trip.

It’s not exciting work, but fixing LoTW problems from the field is worse.

### Add the Callsign to POTA

Next stop was [POTA](https://parksontheair.com/). Under *My Account*, I added the new callsign. Quick and easy. No verification needed.

Some of my portable trips overlap with parks, so it’s better to have this sorted ahead of time.

### Update the Places People Will Look You Up

Once you touch [QRZ](https://www.qrz.com/), the whole ecosystem starts noticing: [DX‑World](https://www.dx-world.net/), [Daily DX](https://www.dailydx.com/), [DX News](https://dxnews.com/), all of it. So timing matters.

- ### Suffix/Prefix Callsigns  
  For operating variations like `/P`, `/4`, `/VE3`, or similar, these get added under:  
  **Account → Secondary Callsigns**

  This keeps all your derivative calls linked properly to your main profile.

- ### Newly Issued Callsigns  
  If the callsign is actually *issued to you*, it goes under:  
  **Account → Managed Callsigns**

  This ensures the new callsign has a proper identity on its own, while still being tied to your main account for logging and profile management.

### Club Log, for the Log Uploads That Matter

Finally, I added the callsign under *Settings → Callsigns* in [Club Log](https://clublog.org/).

### Wrapped Up

It’s not glamorous, but getting a new callsign integrated everywhere is just part of the prep work: same category as booking houses, sorting flights, or confirming rental cars. Now that it’s done, the next time this callsign goes on the air, everything should just work.
